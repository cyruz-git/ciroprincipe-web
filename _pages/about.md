I'm a *Computer Science* graduate with a keen interest in all things IT-related. My interests span from 
**Systems/Networks Administration** to **Programming**, with a particular passion for **Scripting** and **Automation**.

In the past, I've held roles as a *Teacher*, *Reviewer*, *Supply Manager*, *Network Support Engineer*, and *IT Consultant*, 
giving me diverse and extensive working experience. Currently, I serve as an **IT Officer** for 
[Costa Crociere S.p.A.](http://www.costacruise.com) aboard their fleet's ships.

This position allows me to engage with various languages and cultures, travel the world, and discover new places 
while honing my managerial skills.

Apart from my passion for IT, I thoroughly enjoy watching and playing football (you know, I'm Italian) and I'm fond of 
thought-provoking films, experimental music, and classic video games.
